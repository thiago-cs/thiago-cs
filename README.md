- 👋 Hi, I’m @thiago-cs
- 👀 I’m interested in developing software that contribute to making people's lives better.
- 🌱 I have experience building C#/WPF tools to solve problems (e.g. work automation) and I’m currently learning Web Development with React, and Python (add ASP.NET to the list, looks a lot like C# which I just love).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open software in general.
- 📫 You can reach me at thiagocs.cci@hotmail.com
